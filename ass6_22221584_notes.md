1.
Created a new directory named 'thesis' at the user level and used touch to create a document called 'ass6_22221584_notes.md' inside it.

2.
Untarred my tarball into ~/thesis/ to create a directory with:

thesis/fastqc_script.py

thesis/trimm_script.py

thesis/README.txt

thesis/test_data

thesis/fastqc_out

thesis/trim_out

thesis/ass6_22221584_notes.md

3.
Verified that I still had git installed from previous work, then committed my thesis directory to it.
